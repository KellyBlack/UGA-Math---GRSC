Hi everyone,

I hope you've been having a good first day of classes so far! 

I wanted to go ahead and send you all some information about one of the more time sensitive components of this course. As a part of this course, you are all required to complete the professional development course for the University's Non-discrimination and anti-harassment policy. If you do not complete this during the semester you will receive an incomplete in this course. This is a departmental requirement that all faculty and students are required to fulfill, and the topics covered in these sessions are directly linked to our mission to foster an environment that allows all of us the same opportunities to grow and thrive. Once you complete your session you should forward the email notification you receive to me (terrin@uga.edu). Detailed information and scheduling for the session can be found on the Professional Education Portal:

Log in to PEP using the following URL: https://pep.uga.edu/

Once you are logged in, you can type the course name in the search bar to find the available sessions for this semester and register. The name of the course is the following:

“Certificate in Diversity and Inclusion (CDI): UGA's Non Discrimination Anti-Harassment Policy and the USG Sexual Misconduct Policy.”

There should be a few different dates to choose from but there is a limited seating capacity in each one so the sooner you register, the better! It should only take a minute or two to sign up so please go ahead and get this out of the way as soon as possible! If you have any questions, please let me know. 

Cheers, 

Terrin
