\subsection{Daily discussions}
\label{sec:daily-discussions}

Looking at the syllabus, you'll see that most days have a ``daily discussion'' component.  This means:

\begin{itemize}
\item Each week, one of the groups of students will lead the discussion on last week's reading.
\item They should spend 5-7 minutes at the board, outlining and summarizing the reading.  
\item Then they should lead the class discussion for another 5-7 minutes.
\end{itemize}
