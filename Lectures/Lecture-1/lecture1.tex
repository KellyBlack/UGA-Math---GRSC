\section{Overview}

Here is a brief overview of the course.

\subsection{Pedagogy}
\label{sec:pedagogy}

Teaching pedagogy is hard for several reasons

\begin{enumerate}
\item It's likely that you don't know much about it.
\item There's a surprisingly large amount of literature, and it's hard to navigate.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Concrete outcomes}
\label{sec:concrete-outcomes}

There are several concrete outcomes that should be produced during this course.  They are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every student should have a website posted on the UGA directory.  With a thumbnail picture.
\item This website should have a CV.
\item Every student should have created their own syllabus, and be familiar with the rules of syllabi.
\item Every student should have a 10 minute video of them teaching.
\item Every student should have evalulated another professor on their teaching abilities.
\end{enumerate}

Other activities which I think are important

\begin{enumerate}
\item Have \emph{cheating} day.
\item Have \emph{syllabus} day.
\item Have other graduate students come in and have a panel.
\item Have website with teaching advice on it.  'What I wish I knew the first time I taught'\ldots
\item Much of what this course is collecting information and resources for students.
\item Have \emph{grading} day (probably two!)
\end{enumerate}
