\section{Bridge splittings of knots and links}
\label{sec:bridge-splitt-knots}

We'll begin with a review of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item knots and links
\item bridge number and its properties
\item bridge splittings
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Knots and links}
\label{sec:knots-links}

Consider $S^{3} = \R^{3} \cup \{\infty\}$.  An embedded, closed $1$-manifold $L \subset S^{3}$ is called a \emph{link}, and a connected link is called a \emph{knot}.

We consider links up to \emph{ambient isotopy}, i.e., we say that two links $L$ and $L'$ are equivalent if and only if there exists a family of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms
  \[
    f_{t}: S^{3} \to S^{3}, \quad t \in [0,1], 
  \]
  such that $f_{0} = \one_{S^{3}}$ and $f_{1}(L) = L'$.

  

  A link $L$ is a \emph{split union}, written $L = L_{1} \sqcup L_{2}$ if there exist $B^{3}$'s $B_{i} \subset S^{3}$ such that $B_{1} \cap B_{2} = \emptyset$ and $L_{i} \subset B_{i}$.


  
\begin{theorem}
  Every knot $K$ can be decomposed as $K = K_{1} \# K_{2} \# \cdots \# K_{n}$ for some $n \in \N$ and some prime knots $K_{i}$.  Moreover, such a decomposition is unique up to re-ordering.
\end{theorem}

\begin{exercise}
  Check that any such band will do.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

\subsubsection{The unknot}
\label{sec:unknot}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The \emph{unknot} $U$ is the boundary of an embedded disk $E$ in $S^{3}$.
  \item The $n$-component unlink $U_{n} = U \sqcup U \cdots \sqcup U$.
  \item The \emph{torus link} $T_{p,q}$.
  \item Satellite links.
  \end{itemize}
  

\begin{theorem}
  Every prime knot is either a torus knot, a satellite knot, or a hyperbolic knot.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  The unknot has no non-trivial companions.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{Morse function} on a smooth $n$-manifold $M^{n}$ is a smooth map $f:M \to \R$ such that every critical point is non-degenerate (a point $x \in M$ is a \emph{critical point} if $d_{x}f = 0$; a critical point $x \in M$ is \emph{degenerate} if the Hessian matrix at $x$ is singular.)
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  If $p$ is a non-degenerate critical point, there exists a chart $(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n})$ in a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that $x_{i}(p) = 0$ and $f(x) = f(p) - x_{1}^{2} - \cdots - $
\end{lemma}
